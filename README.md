# Medical Cost Prediction

This data science project aims to build a predictive model to estimate individual medical costs using health-related attributes. The project leverages a dataset containing various factors, such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region, to identify the primary drivers of medical expenses.

## Project Overview

Health insurance providers often need to estimate the medical costs of individuals based on specific health and lifestyle factors. This project explores regression models to predict these costs, offering insights that can assist insurance companies in premium calculation, healthcare providers in resource allocation, and individuals in financial planning.

## Dataset Information

The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance), includes 1,338 records with the following columns:

- **Age**: Age of the primary beneficiary
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight
- **Children**: Number of children covered by health insurance
- **Smoker**: Smoking status of the individual
- **Region**: Residential area in the US
- **Charges**: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

## Objective

The primary objective is to develop a model that accurately predicts medical costs based on these features, enabling insights into the main factors influencing expenses.

## Approach

The project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing distributions, correlations, and cost-influencing factors.
3. **Model Selection**: Implementing multiple regression models, including:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score.
5. **Result Interpretation**: Analyzing key cost drivers and comparing the model performances.

## Key Findings

- The **Random Forest Regressor** yielded the best performance with an R² score of 0.80, achieving the most accurate predictions.
- Major factors influencing costs include:
  - **Smoking**: Significant increase in costs for smokers.
  - **BMI**: Higher medical expenses for individuals with BMI > 30.
  - **Age**: Older individuals have higher predicted costs.
  
These insights highlight the potential for machine learning in healthcare, particularly for risk assessment and budget planning.

## Results

The best-performing model, **Random Forest Regressor**, achieved the following metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 2937
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 5218
- **R² Score**: 0.80

## Libraries Used

- **Python**: Project programming language
- **Scikit-Learn**: Model building and evaluation
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization

## Conclusion

The project successfully built a model that estimates medical expenses based on health and lifestyle factors. The insights generated by this project can assist in decision-making processes in the healthcare and insurance sectors, enhancing risk assessment and resource planning.
